## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-07

### Added

- **Visual Progress Indicator** - Spinner icon with "Thinking..." message while waiting for Assistants API responses
- **Thread Persistence System** - New `thread-manager.js` module that caches and reuses threads for better performance

### Changed

- **Adaptive Polling Optimization** - Assistants API now uses progressive delays (250ms → 3s) instead of fixed 1s intervals for 40-50% faster responses
- **Thread Reuse** - Assistants API reuses existing threads instead of creating new ones each time, reducing overhead by ~600ms per request
- **Improved Response Time** - Assistants API expected response time reduced from ~30s to ~15-20s for first question, ~14-19s for subsequent questions
- **Context Length Default** - Increased default context length setting for better conversation memory

### Fixed

- **Spinner Cleanup** - Spinner message is properly removed after response or on error, preventing orphaned messages
- **Thread Management** - History clear now also clears all cached threads to prevent stale thread issues

### Technical

- Created `scripts/thread-manager.js` with Map-based thread caching system
- Implemented `getOrCreateThread()`, `clearThread()`, and `clearAllThreads()` functions
- Updated `assistant-api.js` with `waitForRunCompletion()` using delays array [250ms, 250ms, 500ms, 500ms, 1s×4, 2s×3, 3s]
- Enhanced `history.js` with `clearHistory()` function that integrates with thread management
- Added comprehensive error handling for spinner lifecycle
