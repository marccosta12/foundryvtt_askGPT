## Quick Start

1. **Get your API key** from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
2. **Install the module** using: `https://github.com/marccosta12/foundryvtt_SmartChatAI/releases/latest/download/module.json`
3. **Configure settings** with your API key and preferred AI engine
4. **Start asking!** Use `/?` or `/w gpt` in chat

## Usage Examples

### Public Questions - Everyone Sees Everything
Use `/?` when you want to share the AI response with all players at the table.

```
/? what's the cost of standing up from prone?
```
**Visible to:** All players  
**Response:** Standing up from prone costs half of your movement speed.

### Private Questions - Only You and GM
Use `/w gpt` for questions you don't want players to see (plot details, damage calculations, secrets). Only the sender and GM will see both the question and response.

```
/w gpt time to don and doff armor
```
**Visible to:** Sender + GM  
**Response:** According to the rules in the Player's Handbook, donning and doffing armor takes:

| Armor Type   | Donning Time | Doffing Time |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Light Armor  | 1 minute     | 1 minute     |
| Medium Armor | 5 minutes    | 1 minute     |
| Heavy Armor  | 10 minutes   | 5 minutes    |
| Shield       | 1 action     | 1 action     |

**Include specific players:** You can also whisper to specific players by name:
```
/w [gpt, PlayerName] can I counterspell this effect?
```

## Features

### Two AI Modes
- **Chat Completions API** - Fast, lightweight, great for quick rules lookups and inspiration
- **Assistants API** - Powerful, with custom knowledge bases and persistent context (bring your own Assistant ID)

### Game System Support
Built-in support for D&D 5e, Pathfinder 2e and generic systems. Customize prompts for any ruleset.

### Context Management
Maintain conversation history across multiple turns. Adjust context window size to balance memory and token usage.

### Flexible Configuration
- Select model version (GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, or GPT-3.5)
- Customize system prompts for your campaign
- Configure context length for conversation memory
- Optional: Use your custom OpenAI Assistant for advanced features

## How It Works

The module intercepts `/?` and `/w gpt` commands in Foundry VTT chat and sends them to your chosen OpenAI API. Responses are formatted with proper Markdown support and integrated into your game's chat log.

Your custom prompts determine how the AI behaves—whether it acts as a knowledgeable GM assistant, rules adjudicator, or creative inspiration engine. The AI understands rulesets for popular game systems but always benefits from additional context in custom prompts.

> **💡 Security Tip:** Like all Foundry modules, settings are visible to players with console access. For shared games, we recommend creating a dedicated OpenAI API key with spending limits at [OpenAI Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits). This way you can safely share AI features while controlling costs.
