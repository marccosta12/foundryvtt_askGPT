## Quick Start

1. **Get your API key** from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
2. **Install the module** using: `https://github.com/marccosta12/foundryvtt_askGPT/releases/latest/download/module.json`
3. **Configure settings** with your API key and preferred AI engine
4. **Start asking!** Use `/?` or `/w gpt` in chat

## Usage Examples

### Public Questions (Visible to Everyone)
```
/? what's the cost of standing up from prone?
```
**Response:** Standing up from prone costs half of your movement speed.

### Private Whispers (DM & Sender Only)
```
/w [gpt, gm] time to don and doff armor
```
**Response:** According to the rules in the Player's Handbook, donning and doffing armor takes:

| Armor Type   | Donning Time | Doffing Time |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Light Armor  | 1 minute     | 1 minute     |
| Medium Armor | 5 minutes    | 1 minute     |
| Heavy Armor  | 10 minutes   | 5 minutes    |
| Shield       | 1 action     | 1 action     |

## Features

### Two AI Modes
- **Chat Completions API** - Fast, lightweight, great for quick rules lookups and inspiration
- **Assistants API** - Powerful, with custom knowledge bases and persistent context (bring your own Assistant ID)

### Game System Support
Built-in support for D&D 5e, Pathfinder 2e and generic systems. Customize prompts for any ruleset.

### Context Management
Maintain conversation history across multiple turns. Adjust context window size to balance memory and token usage.

### Flexible Configuration
- Choose your AI engine (Chat or Assistants)
- Select model version (GPT-4 or GPT-3.5)
- Customize system prompts for your campaign
- Configure context length for conversation memory
- Uses your custom OpenAI Assistant

## How It Works

The module intercepts `/?` and `/w gpt` commands in Foundry VTT chat and sends them to your chosen OpenAI API. Responses are formatted with proper Markdown support and integrated into your game's chat log.

Your custom prompts determine how the AI behaves—whether it acts as a knowledgeable GM assistant, rules adjudicator, or creative inspiration engine. The AI understands rulesets for popular game systems but always benefits from additional context in custom prompts.

> **💡 Security Tip:** Like all Foundry modules, settings are visible to players with console access. For shared games, we recommend creating a dedicated OpenAI API key with spending limits at [OpenAI Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits). This way you can safely share AI features while controlling costs.
